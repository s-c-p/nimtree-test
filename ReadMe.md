# Nimtree.io Recruitment Task

To parse XML export of Tally's transactions and convert it into `.xlsx` file according to template <!--(which, hopefully, is generated by one of Tally's softwares)--> `2-output.xlsx` **only for voucher type "Receipt"**. (and it seems `0-raw.xlsx` is a possible *represnetation* of what Tally'd see for the given input XML)

## Ways to standout

 * create [ReST] API to generate result
  * query string for recipt and other voucher types?
  * 2xx and 4xx error codes
 * optimization
  * NOTE: avoid until confident about correctness
 * robust code
